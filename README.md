# PICKit Clone #
📖 About The Project

This project aims to build a fully open-source, cost-effective clone of the Microchip PICKit programmer/debugger. While the original PICKit is a standard tool for PIC microcontrollers, this project seeks to provide a transparent hardware design and firmware implementation that can be studied, modified, and built by the community.

The goal is not just to replicate functionality, but to create a learning platform for embedded programmers and hardware designers interested in:

ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming) protocols.

USB Device implementations.

High-voltage generation circuits (VPP).

Low cost hardware.

## ⚠️ Current Status ##

Current Phase: 🚧 Hardware Design & Schematic Capture

We are currently in the initial design phase. The focus is on selecting components, finalizing the power architecture, and routing the initial PCB.

[ ] System Architecture Definition

[ ] Schematic Capture

[ ] PCB Layout

[ ] Prototype Assembly

[ ] Firmware Development

[ ] Testing & Validation

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

To view or edit the files, you will need:
